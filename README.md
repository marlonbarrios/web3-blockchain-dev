As a founder and leader of MotionDAO the founder, I facilitate contexts of adoption and creative experimentation using Web3 technologies; investigating its impacts on ownership, governance and value creation within local and global communities of artists; MotionDAO operates supported and supporting the social networks dance-tech.net and movimiento.org. MotionDAO is part of the Near Protocol ecosystem.

I have developed and curated social networks since 2008. The dance-tech.net (English) and movimiento.org (in Spanish and Portuguese) have explored the potential of the web2.0 for knowledge production and distribution about body based artistic practices and it's intersections with other disciplines such as new media, architecture, philosophy, anthropology and more. All dance-tech projects attempt to situate embodiment as a fundamental condition and movement arts relevant practices of the contemporary with an interdisciplinary framework.
